The Karnataka Teacher Eligibility Test (KARTET) is a highly competitive exam that determines the eligibility of candidates for primary and upper primary-level
teaching positions in Karnataka. However, the long turnaround time between the exam and the publication of results creates uncertainty and anxiety among candidates,
making it challenging for them to plan their future steps.To address this issue, we propose a machine learning model that can predict a candidate's likelihood of
selection based on their KARTET exam scores and historical data on the previous year's results. This will enable candidates to make informed decisions and set 
realistic expectations about their chances of selection, reducing their stress and anxiety.
